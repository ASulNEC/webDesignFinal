		<h1>About Me</h1>
		
		<p>My name is Aiden Sullivan.  I am 19 years old, and I have always loved games and music.  My goal with this site is to spread the love I feel in these topics with the rest of the world.</p>
		<h2>Games</h2>
		<p>I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember.  I have put countless hours into numerous games, and I would like to think that I have acquired a good amount of skill in some of them.  For example, I have put hundreds of hours into Hollow Knight and about a hundred hours in Celeste.</p>

		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>I have been playing music for a long time, but I only really started to feel passionate about it for about 5 years, roughly since the start of high school.  Since then, I have been able to take the knowledge I had from music lessons as a kid and apply them to the instruments that I was now feeling a lot of passion for.</p>
